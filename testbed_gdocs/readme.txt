This folder contains no local copies of GDocs HTML input files.
In the nature of GDocs all documents are always in the cloud at Google,
so it makes more sense to reference to URLs of public GDocs documents.

The file
  testbed_gdocs_urls.cfg
contains all URLs to public GDocs documents which are used in this testbed.

If you add URLs to this file please keep sure that they are public accessible.
