      <para id="gd-id1142484">Connexions contains educational materials at all levels - from children to college students to professionals - organized in small modules that can be connected into larger courses. Material is authored by people from all walks of life. Much content is created by university professors, but the collection also contains very popular music content created by a part-time music teacher.</para>
      <para id="gd-id1142487">Connexions popular material is translated into many languages, aided by the open-content licensing.</para>
